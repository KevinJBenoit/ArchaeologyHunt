As you take in the sprawling desert hellscape before you, you begin to doubt
your decision. But what choice did you have? Your dear father, the man who
raised you, is now facing death. You know he won't last long in a foreign jail,
especially since he was arrested under suspicion of espionage. He's always
sticking his nose where he shouldn't. "But that's archeology for you", my dad
would say. God, what a fool I was to follow in his footsteps.

You know the greedy guard at the jail is willing to take a bribe if you are able
to come up with an acceptable offer quickly. And if the rumors of this desert
are true, then there is treasure here for the taking. Not only gems but an
ancient artifact once belonging to the Pharaoh himself. Unfortunately, there's
another more sinister rumor too. A cursed mummy guards this desert, laying to
waste all life that it encounters. But if you can just find the artifact and
collect enough gems, you'll be able to save your father. 

As you begin to step forward into the wasteland, you spot a welcome sight on the
horizon. A merchant's canopy! No doubt full of tools and equipment to help you
finish this job in one piece. Warmed by the thought you begin your perilous
journey...

Goals:
Collect Pharaoh's Artifact
