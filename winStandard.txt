You can't believe your luck as you palm the weight of Pharaoh's artifact in your
pocket. Unfortunately, you were unable to collect the number of gems needed to
bribe the greedy guard. Tears make streaks on your dust-ridden face as you think
of your poor father. But at least you kept your own life from the clutches of
the mummy and have the means to get a ticket home. You console yourself with the
thought that your father would want the artifact safely preserved in a museum,
but you know this is a hollow rationalization.
